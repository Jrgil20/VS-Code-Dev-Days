## 📋 Event Organization Checklist

To assist you in organizing your event, we've created a practical checklist covering the key aspects to consider when planning. This guide is designed to help you run a successful technical event, ensuring nothing important is overlooked.

### 👥 1. Initial Planning

- [x] Connect with partners in your community to assist with event organization and support. This includes roles such as check-in, main host, timekeeping, and content delivery (speakers, facilitators, and proctors).
- [x] Establish the **date and time** for the event (i24/09/2025, 11:00-14:00).

### 🏢 2. Initial Planning: Venue and Logistics

- [x] Find an **appropriate venue** (Universidad Catoloica Andtres Bello to host the event). As the event is hands-on, ensure the venue has enough space for participants to work comfortably.
- [x] Verify the **venue capacity** (80 participants).
- [x] Check the **infrastructure** (tables, chairs, stable Wi-Fi, projector or large display, microphone for larger spaces).
- [x] Confirm the **ease of access** (public transportation, parking). This information is **important for participants** and you should include it in your registration page.
- [ ] You are open to find sponsorship to offer **food and drinks** (water, coffee, snacks).

> [!TIP]
> You can include the logos of space, food, and swag partners on the registration page and event promotional materials. This highlights sponsors and partners, and helps strengthen future collaborations.

### 🎤 3. Content: Speakers & Facilitators

In our agenda, we have planned 2 sessions and 1 workshop. **This means you should engage partners from your community to help deliver these activities.**

- [x] Identify and invite speakers to lead the presentations.
- [x] Recruit facilitators and proctors to run the workshops and support hands-on learning. A proctor is someone who can assist participants during practical activities.

- [ ] Prepare a **backup plan** in case a speaker or facilitator is unable to attend.

**Here is a reminder of the agenda:**

- [x] Create an **event registration page** with detailed event information. [Here is an example: registration-page-draft](registration-page-draft.md).
- [x] Check with your venue which information they need to allow access and include this information in your registration form (i.e. name, email, experience level with GitHub, etc).
- [ ] **Use our templates to create banners for your event page and social media (Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.).** You can find all [available templates in the marketing folder](../marketing/).
